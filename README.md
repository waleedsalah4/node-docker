# Dockerized Node.js App with MongoDB, Redis, Nginx, and Installing and configuring Docker & Docker Compose on an AWS EC2 instance

This is a learning project demonstrating how to containerize a Node.js application with Docker, use multiple services (MongoDB, Redis), reverse proxy traffic using Nginx, and deployed the project on an AWS EC2 instance

---

## üöÄ What I Learned

- How to write a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- Linking multiple services (Node.js, MongoDB, Redis) with Docker Compose
- Using Nginx as a reverse proxy for backend services
- Installing and configuring Docker & Docker Compose on an AWS EC2 instance
- SSHing into EC2 and running containers on a cloud server

---

## üì¶ Services Used

- **Node.js**: Backend API using Express.js
- **MongoDB**: Database service
- **Redis**: Caching or pub/sub service
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to the Node.js app
- **AWS EC2**: Hosting the application in the cloud

## üìù Notes

- This app is for learning purposes and uses dummy credentials
- This project was built as part of my learning journey in backend development and DevOps basics.
